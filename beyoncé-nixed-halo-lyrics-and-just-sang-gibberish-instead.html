Subsequently, he hurt his heel and had to get surgery to fix it.</p><p id=par-4_61>“I had not written a song in probably two months at this point, I called my friend Evan Bogart and said, ‘I got three hours by myself today, I’m going crazy, can you come over, let’s write for Beyoncé,'” he recalled. Bogart gave us songs such as Rihanna’s “SOS,” Hot Chelle Rae’s “Tonight Tonight,” and Usher and Enrique Iglesias’ “Dirty Dancer.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>‘Halo’ became an angelic song because of a certain setting on a keyboard</h2><p id=par-5_49>Tedder discussed the evolution of “Halo.” “I turned on my keyboard, and the very first thing that came out sounded like a bunch of angels singing, and that’s the intro of ‘Halo,'” he said. “It was total luck that the particular keyboard patch that came on sounded like angels.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_49>Tedder said the keyboard inspired the lyrics of “Halo.” “I was like, ‘If you’re looking at an angel, you can see their halo. What if you’re staring at the person you love and you can see their halo?'” he said. “That entire song was written in under three hours.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_49>Beyoncé didn’t sing all of Tedder’s lyrics. “I did this piano solo in the bridge and Beyoncé ended up, instead of doing the lyrics that were in the bridge, she just sang my piano melody, which is insanity because it was not an easy one to do,” he recalled.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>How the song and Beyoncé’s ‘I Am… Sasha Fierce’ performed in the United States</h2><p id=par-8_38>“Halo” became a big hit for Queen B.
