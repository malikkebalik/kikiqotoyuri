But in an era where a new piece of superhero-related media seemingly drops every week, the classic Marvel and DC characters get most of the attention. What about lesser-known characters getting an opportunity to shine?&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_52>An <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">animated series</a> called <a href=#>Invincible</a> is giving viewers a chance to see a new kind of superhero, and fans seem to love it so far. Let’s take a closer look at the main character from that series, Mark Grayson, and six facts to know about his original version depicted in the comics.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-premise-of-invincible>What is the premise of ‘Invincible?’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_56>According to <a href=#>IGN</a>, the Amazon Prime series Invincible tells the story of a young man named Mark Grayson. He is a normal teenager. He’s a fan of comic books. He goes to high school every day, living a mostly mundane existence there. He’s also pining after a girl who doesn’t ever seem to notice him.</p><p id=par-4_38>The only major difference between Mark and other kids is that his father is a superhero named Omni-Man. While Mark at first finds himself to be unremarkable, he slowly discovers that he has powers like his father.</p><p id=par-5_31>He quickly becomes a superhero — he names himself Invincible — in an attempt to follow the legacy of his Dad. But it isn’t quite as simple as Mark would like.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-grayson-s-backstory-in-the-comics>Mark Grayson’s backstory in the comics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_25>Comic writer Robert Kirkman created Mark. Kirkman also created the comic series The Walking Dead. Mark’s comic, Invincible, had a 144-issue run from 2003-2018.</p><p id=par-7_38>After a decade and a half of his own stories and spinoffs, the character came to an end.&nbsp; In the comics, Mark’s mother is named Deborah and his father’s alter-ego is that of a man named Nolan.</p><p id=par-8_27>Much like Superman hailing from Krypton, Nolan is of an alien race known as the Viltrumite. Mark is half-Viltrumite, which is where he gets his powers from.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-things-to-know-about-mark-grayson-from-the-invincible-comic-book>6 things to know about Mark Grayson from the ‘Invincible’ comic book</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Invincible-Key-Art-e1619143769231.jpg><p id=par-9_33>For fans of the show, it helps to know where Mark came from as a character. It may help them better understand his motivations and where he may head in the future.</p><p id=par-10_23><a href=#>Screen Rant</a> compiled some facts about the character from the comics, and here are six you need to know (warning: potential spoilers ahead):&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>His father was motivated to come to Earth thanks to a deadly disease. </strong>The Scourge Virus is a sickness created by Omni-Man’s people that eventually afflicts them. Omni-Man retreats to Earth to escape the virus, leading to him eventually fathering Mark.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Unlike another famous hero, he’s only half-alien. </strong>Many elements of Mark’s story mirror that of Superman. But whereas Superman was 100% Kryptonian, Mark is only half-alien. His mother is a human being. Superman’s humanity was forged in his humble upbringing by the Kents. Mark’s is reinforced through his mother.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mark got his costume from his friend. </strong>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Spider-Man gets his outfit from <a href=#>Tony Stark</a>. In the Invincible comics, it’s Mark’s friend Art who designs his costume for him. He also creates the costume for Omni-Man.&nbsp;In the Invincible series, Art is Omni-Man’s friend and serves as a designer for all superheroes.</li><li><strong>He creates his own Teen Titans-like group. </strong>Mark teams up with several other teenagers to form a squad known as the “Teen Team.”&nbsp;In the tv show, the team already exists and Mark becomes friends with them.</li><li><strong>He falls in love with another superhero. </strong>Sort of like Reed and Sue Richards, Mark finds himself falling for another gifted individual known as Atom Eve. The duo shares a long romance together.</li><li><strong>There’s a connection to another beloved hero. </strong>Released under the Image Comics banner, Invincible features a cameo from fellow Image superhero Spawn. Spawn famously had a popular comic, movie, and TV series based on him in the 90s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=par-11_27>With plenty of source material to draw from, Invincible fans don’t have to worry. The show’s creators have plenty of great Mark Grayson stories to draw from.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r8LIp5qimpyaend506Ggp5%2BjYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMppiro12cv6LF0qilZ6Ckorlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
