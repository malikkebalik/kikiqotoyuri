The latest example: Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, the Russian oligarch whose 223-foot Ragnar is now reportedly stranded at a port somewhere in <a href=#>Norway</a>, says the Huffington Post.</p><p>Unlike most recent stories about Russian-owned yachts in peril, this isn't a case of official government sanctioning. Despite reported direct ties to <a href=#>Putin</a>, Strzhalkovsky is not yet among those wealthy Russian business leaders to be officially sanctioned by the EU or the US. But locals in Norway have decided to impose some sanctions of their own, refusing to fuel up Ragnar in view of its owner's links to Russia. Sven Holmlund, one such local oil supplier, told Norwegian NRK "Why should we help them? They can row home. Or use a sail."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330095 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vladimir-Strzhalkovsky.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330095 class=wp-caption-text>ALEXEY DRUZHININ/AFP via Getty Images</p><p>Politicians in Norway are reportedly seeking to have the craft confiscated, but that can't legally happen without a directive from the European Union.</p><p>As for the yacht itself, it's an impressive feat of custom craftsmanship. Here's how the Yacht Club of Monaco (the flag of which the yacht officially flies) describes the craft on its official site:</p><p><strong>"Built in 2012, this ship was originally a 68-metre supply vessel, and has been completely refitted by the ICON company as an exploration superyacht. This 'explorer,' which has a range of 6,000 nautical miles, is now capable of sailing anywhere in the world, as far as the Arctic."</strong></p><p>The Ragnar's icebreaker and polar hull allows it to travel pretty much anywhere. It was engineered for scientific exploration as well as pleasure, with equipment that can transmit oceanographic and meteorological data even in harsh atmospheric conditions. But, despite all its advanced features, it still needs fuel. And that means it will likely remain stuck in Norway for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue56pdGxrYGWGdQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
