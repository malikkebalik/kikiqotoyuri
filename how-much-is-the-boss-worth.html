With that kind of longevity, the New Jersey native is surely rolling in dough, right? Here’s a look at how much The Boss is worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bruce-Springsteen-Photos-1980s-concert-GettyImages-3179750.jpg><h2>What is Bruce Springsteen’s net worth in 2018?</h2><p id=par-2_36><a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Springsteen is worth a cool $500 million and his annual salary is estimated to be about $80 million. They estimate he earned roughly $40 million between June 2017 and June 2018.</p><p id=par-3_71>This is quite a jump in income for the Hall of Famer. In 2016, Forbes reported Springsteen’s net worth to be around $460 million — which, at the time, ranked him 14th among celebrities raking in the big bucks. (As of 2018,&nbsp;<a href=#>he was ranked 84th by Forbes</a>.) Since he continues to sell out shows no matter where he tours, it appears unlikely the 69-year-old’s fortunes will be slowing down anytime soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Bruce-Springsteen.jpg><h2>Where does most of his money come from?</h2><p id=par-4_57>According to Forbes, the “Born To Run” singer makes most of his money by touring. (Which makes sense since he big record-making days are behind him but he can still go around and sells out cities while he plays the hits.) The 2016 article&nbsp;reports that, at the time, Springsteen had grossed over $1.5 million from touring alone.</p><p id=par-5_66>It’s easy to see how life on the road can be so lucrative for the rocker. In 2016, tickets for his shows were being <a href=#>resold on StubHub for as much as $10,000 a pop</a>. (How many people actually dropped that much cheddar to go see The Boss is another story. Although it was reportedly one of the most successful concerts that year, <a href=#>raking in $171 million</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bruce-Springsteen-photos-1980s-early-Bruce-on-stage-GettyImages-3179823.jpg><h2>How does he spend his money?</h2><p id=par-6_57>Springsteen’s big splurge is a 200-acre horse farm&nbsp;in Colts Neck, New Jersey that’s reportedly worth more than $10 million. While he’s bought and <a href=#>sold a few homes in his home state</a> over the years, he and his wife,&nbsp;Patti Scialfa, still live at the Colts Neck property. He also reportedly owns homes in Los Angeles and in Florida.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs8HCnmSsqKKeu6i%2F056cp2WYpMRuudScn2aho2LBqbGMm6asq12svLPAx2efraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
