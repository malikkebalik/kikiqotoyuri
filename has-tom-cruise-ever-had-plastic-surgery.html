All jokes aside, could the reason behind Cruise’s refusal to age be more surgical than mystical? Understandably, the question comes up frequently as people wonder how exactly the actor appears to be standing still as time passes around him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Cruise-Top-Gun-Maverick.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>In fact, the question was posed to him back in 2012 in an interview with Playboy, which just goes to show how long people have been trying to figure out the actor’s secrets. However, Cruise confirmed at the time that he had never had surgery, and that it was something he would never do. So maybe he really is a vampire, or perhaps Scientology holds the key. Maybe they’ve found the fountain of youth. Who knows, but something is definitely up, as the actor barely looks 40.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>That interview was a long time ago, though, so it’s definitely possible that Cruise could have changed his mind since then. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission: Impossible</a> star made an appearance at a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants at the end of 2021, and his appearance once again raised questions. His face appeared quite puffy and swollen, causing everyone from fans, to news sites, armchair surgeons to actual surgeons to weigh in on whether they believed that the actor had gone back on his word and decided to have surgery.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 📺✨ 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘾𝙧𝙪𝙞𝙨𝙚 𝙁𝙖𝙣 ✨📺 (@tomcruise_fan_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>Whilst the general belief was that he had indeed had some form of facial surgery, most likely fillers, the actor himself has never confirmed nor denied this, so who’s to say whether he has or not. It could just be a fluctuation in weight or a different diet. Nonetheless, the actor was back with his usual chiseled jawline and slim facial features a few weeks later, possibly indicating that it could have been swelling from a surgical procedure.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>It’s likely that Cruise will never really confirm whether or not he actually has had surgery. He’s done a great job at holding onto his youth so far, and he’s still taking lots of physically-demanding roles, enduring as living proof that you’re only as old as you feel.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=false>You can catch Cruise in theaters this year and try to make your own mind up on the surgery debate, as he’s starring in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, that releases on July 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1or%2BMraamZZOnwqq%2FxGacr52iYrWisIypo5qrpJ6wbr%2FUq56eqqlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
