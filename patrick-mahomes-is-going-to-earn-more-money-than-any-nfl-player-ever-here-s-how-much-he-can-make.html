Last year, he won the MVP award as he threw for more than 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns. This season, he's led the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, thanks to a pair of double-digit comeback victories in the playoffs.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This offseason, Mahomes is going to get paid – and then some.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though Mahomes still has two years left on his rookie deal, he's eligible to receive a contract extension this spring. And all signs point to him getting one worth more than any player before him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In fact, the Chiefs have been preparing for this since 2017. GM Mike Veach told The Ringer at the beginning of the season that every move the team has made has been with the idea that they'd offer Mahomes an extension as soon as they could.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-292782 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1081592524.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-292782 class=wp-caption-text>Jamie Squire/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, the question becomes how much. It's very likely Mahomes could make a deal worth $200 million or more. We just have to take a look at the competition.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Atlanta's <a href=# title="Matt Ryan Net Worth">Matt Ryan</a> currently owns the highest contract in the league, both in total value ($150 million) and total money guaranteed ($94.5 million). <a href=# title="Russell Wilson Net Worth">Russell Wilson's</a> deal is the highest average salary of all quarterbacks, worth $35 million a year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Looking only at guarantees, <a href=# title="Aaron Rodgers Net Worth">Aaron Rodgers</a> received $79.5 million guaranteed in his latest extension with the Packers – more guaranteed money at signing than anyone else. And <a href=# title="Kirk Cousins Net Worth">Kirk Cousins</a> received the highest fully guaranteed contract, signing a three-year, $84 million deal with the Minnesota Vikings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mahomes has outplayed every single one of those quarterbacks over the past two seasons. And it's not just comparing their past two seasons. Mahomes has thrown for 9,000 yards and 70 touchdowns in fewer than 40 games, per Football Reference. He's one of just two people to ever do that.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Only Houston's <a href=# title="Deshaun Watson Net Worth">Deshaun Watson</a> has also achieved that, and Mahomes did it in fewer games while posting a better completion percentage and passer rating.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Could he set new records in every salary category? $200 million total, $100 million guaranteed, and $40 million annually? It's not such a far-fetched idea.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Right now, Mahomes's biggest focus is the Super Bowl. But win or lose, he's going to make a ton of money this offseason.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqmYraqZmLhuucChpqado2K2tHnGqKCnn12pvG6xwKulZqWfp7Juuc6nnLJlpJ2ur3nAp7BmppaherG4wLKcq2WVq7KzeceeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZiaeqStzWakmqOVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
