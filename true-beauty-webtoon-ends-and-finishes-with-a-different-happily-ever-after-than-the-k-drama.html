The storyline hooked fans as a young girl gains confidence through makeup and gets caught in a love triangle. While the K-drama ended on a good note, the True Beauty webtoon continued and ended on a different happily ever after.</p><p id=par-2_9><strong>[WARNING: This article contains spoilers for&nbsp;True Beauty and webtoon.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-true-beauty-ends-with-ju-kyung-and-su-ho-staying-together>‘True Beauty’ ends with Ju-kyung and Su-ho staying together</h2><p id=par-3_49>The <a href=#>popular romance K-drama</a> ends at 16 episodes with hope and love. While fans held onto hop that Ju-kyung would realize Seo-jun’s feelings for her, fate had other plans. Fans know Su-ho left for the United States after his father collapsed and unceremoniously ended his relationship with Ju-kyung.</p><p id=par-4_53>During that time, Seo-jun’s feelings for Ju-kyung grew stronger, and so did their friendship.

The long-awaited moment finally happened, and the webtoon published its final chapter in 2022.</p><p id=par-8_56>But the True Beauty webtoon ends differently than the K-drama. In chapter 223 on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Webtoon</a>, a long time has passed since the drama. Ju-kyung is a famous Youtube makeup artist, and Seo-jun is still a musician. Near the end of the webtoon, Su-ho fulfills Ju-kyung’s wish of going to the amusement park dressed in school uniforms.</p><p id=par-9_62>But he is nervous about something and has his hand in his pocket. His plans get foiled, and he tries again until it starts raining. Back at home, he sees a barefaced Ju-kyung laughing and feels happy. He realizes he has nothing to worry about, hugs her, kisses her, and asks Ju-kyung to marry him. He gives her a Tiffany ring.</p><p id=par-10_22>The webtoon ends with them watching Seo-jun in concert and him explaining he has finally found a way to be happy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Will there be a ‘True Beauty’ Season 2?</h2><p id=par-11_38>K-dramas are breaking the mold and developing second seasons with continuing storylines.
