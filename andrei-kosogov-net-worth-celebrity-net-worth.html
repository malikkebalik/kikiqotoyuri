Upon his graduation, he went on to work as a commercial director for a small-scale company that was founded with the institute's help.&nbsp;It was in 1992 that he was first appointed by Alfa Group to supervise the formation of a privatization investment fund. Only few months later, Kosogov started to serve as chief executive of Alfa Capital, the group's fund management company.</p><p>Under his guidance, the company has expanded, and in 1998, he became the first deputy of the chairman of the bank to be responsible for all of the bank's investment funds.
