He connected with a family online and developed a friendship.</p><p id=par-3_46>As the relationship progressed he meets the family’s daughter&nbsp;online and falls for her. He documents his pursuit to meet with the daughter in real life. But only to discover the entire relationship and everything&nbsp;he was told was a ruse. The documented journey became the <a href=#>award-winning</a>&nbsp;film, Catfish.</p><p id=par-4_36>After the film launched, Schulman has made a career off of revealing online relationships gone wrong. To date, he’s worth $500,000 <a href=#>Coed</a> reports. So how did he build his wealth? And what controversy surrounds Schulman now?</p><h2>Catfish: The TV Show</h2><p id=par-5_66>MTV picked up on the concept and offered Schulman and cinematographer Max Joseph a deal. Joseph and Schulman hosted and developed a weekly series about catfishing. The series featured people who met someone online but never video chatted or met them in real life. Schuman and Joseph’s job was to get to know the individual. And then help them a real-life encounter with their Internet soulmate.</p><p id=par-6_38>Sometimes the person on the other end of the Internet is who they said they were. But most often they were not, which made for great television. <a href=#>Catfish: The TV Show</a> debuted in 2012 and ran through 2016.</p><h2>The show returns in 2018</h2><p id=par-8_74>After going on hiatus, the series returns November 28, 2018, <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> reports.&nbsp; However is the show relevant anymore? Joseph has since left the series <a href=#>posting on Instagram</a>, “Hey guys, the time has come, sadly, for me to move on from Catfish. Working on this show for the last seven years has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. I’ve learned a lot about myself, my country and human nature in general.”</p><p id=par-9_48>“With Catfish still going strong after 7 seasons, 115 episodes, 31 specials and showing no sign of slowing down, I feel it is finally the time for me to make my exit,” he adds. Schulman is searching for a new co-host and camera person for the current series.</p><h2>Scandal hits (and it has nothing to do with catfishing)</h2><p id=par-10_53>Schulman is accused of sexually harassing a woman who appeared on the show in 2018.&nbsp;Ayissha Morgan filed two police reports alleging Schulman or “the main guy on the show,” sexually harassed her, <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a> reports. Morgan made two videos detailing the instances, which included inappropriate comments to aggressive questioning about Morgan’s sexuality.</p><p id=par-11_74>MTV stopped the production of Catfish: The TV Show as a result. And <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a> reports Schulman has a history of sexual assault. However, Schulman was cleared of the charges in June.&nbsp;“Although we never received a formal complaint, MTV and Critical Content immediately engaged an independent third party investigator,” an MTV spokesperson told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “The independent investigator found the allegations made in the YouTube videos to be not credible and without merit.”</p><p id=par-12_25>As a result,&nbsp;“Given the results of the investigation,&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;will resume filming. We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment.”</p><p id=par-13_5><i>Check out&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s1><i>The Cheat Sheet</i></span></a><i>&nbsp;on Facebook!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZ2pw7R5wpqrn6GjnXqpu9KtZKedpmLApLTUpaSapqNiu6bAjLCmq6yYY7W1ucto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
