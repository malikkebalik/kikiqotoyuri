Cavallari and Colletti, who dated on the show and have remained friends since, were portrayed as idle rich kids in the docuseries, but they said that was not the whole truth.</p><p>For example, they revealed that the hotel room used in the pilot episode of the show "A Black and White Affair" was paid for by production. Cavallari said students at their school "don't go and rent $700 hotel rooms for just a night of fun."&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn't a normal for us," she continued. "We definitely couldn't afford that back then. That was on MTV's dime," added Colletti.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Kristin Cavallari is returning to "Laguna Beach" with a new perspective on the series. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Photo Credit: Dear Media</span></span></figure><p>Colletti said during the preview episode for the podcast that he and the series' <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>other star Lauren Conrad</a> renegotiated their contracts to appear in the show's second season, but he did not share how much they were compensated.&nbsp;</p><p>Cavallari said she also negotiated for a higher fee to appear in season two and negotiated for other compensation during her time on the series as well. "I honestly would have done it for free," said Cavallari. "When they told us they were gonna pay us I was like, oh my God great!"</p><p>She previously told Insider <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>during an interview</a> promoting the new podcast that she asked production to cover her spring break trip to Cabo, which was featured prominently on the first season of the show.</p><p>"I said, okay, well, if you're going to film me in Cabo, then you have to pay for my trip.
