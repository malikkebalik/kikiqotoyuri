I won‚Äôt even blame my Americanness on my lack of interest ‚Äì it‚Äôs just one of those things for which I will always be apathetic. Well, Eurovision has taken over everything, especially Twitter, and people are really into it. This year‚Äôs Eurovision is being held in Liverpool, even though (historically speaking) the rest of Europe doesn‚Äôt care much for Britain or the annual British entry in the Eurovision contest. Was it last year ‚Äì it was the year Italy won, so maybe 2021 ‚Äì I remember seeing that everyone refused to vote for the British entry. Anyway, given that the contest is being hosted in the UK and given that the royal family is the UK‚Äôs most famous ‚Äúexport,‚Äù the Princess of Wales decided to gift everyone with another piano recital, just like she did at <a href=#>her keen Christmas concert in 2021</a>.</p><p>Kate ‚Äújoined‚Äù a performance of the song ‚ÄúSteania‚Äù by Kalush Orchestra, a song from Ukraine which won last year. Kalush Orchestra performed in a metro station in Kyiv, Ukraine. Kate performed at Windsor Castle, wearing a one-shoulder Jenny Packham gown which people are already (correctly) comparing to <a href=#>Meghan‚Äôs Christopher John Rogers look</a> from the BET Awards last year. I bet Kate contacted Jenny Packham right after that and described the exact look she wanted. Apparently, Kate‚Äôs bit was filmed ‚Äúearlier this month.‚Äù So, much like her Christmas piano recital, she pre-recorded it rather than play it live.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A <a href=#>#Eurovision</a> surprise üéπ</p><p>A pleasure to join Kalush Orchestra in a special performance of last year's winning <a href=#>@eurovision</a> entry.</p><p>Enjoy the show, Liverpool ü™© <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y4WDuWvOvb</a></p><p>‚Äî The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a></p><p>Something I don‚Äôt get?
