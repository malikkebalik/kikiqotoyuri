The family relocated to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when Miller was very young, and he attended Brooklyn's Midwood High School and Leetsdale, Pennsylvania's Quaker Valley High School, graduating in 1990. During high school, Wentworth made straight A's and joined the school newspaper staff and the AV club. After graduation, he enrolled at Princeton University, where he served as the school newspaper's cartoonist and sang with The Princeton Tigertones a cappella group.
