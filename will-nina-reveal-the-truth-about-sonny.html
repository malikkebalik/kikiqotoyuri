And, she just might <a href=#>spill what she knows about the not-really-dead Sonny.</a></p><p id=par-4_57>The outlet has a rundown of the teasers provided by the network. The first teaser came from Tuesday’s episode, where we know that Nina started to get in her feelings after her little chat with Wiley.
