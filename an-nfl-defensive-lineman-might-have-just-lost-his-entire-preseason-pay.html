While a team's firmly entrenched starters generally use preseason games to shake off a little rust and start chatting with the media again, rookies and fringe players are giving it their all to make the regular season roster.</p><p>Detroit Lions defensive lineman Kerry Hyder is one of those guys. The 25-year-old has played in only one regular season game – the final one for Detroit last year – and failed to record a tackle. Because of that, he's still looking to make an NFL roster and stick around for awhile.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Hyder hit Cincinnati Bengals quarterback <a href=# title="A.J. McCarron Net Worth">A.J. McCarron</a> in the third quarter of the Bengals' 30-14 win over the Lions back on August 18. He was called for roughing the passer, and ultimately ended up being fined </span><b>$18,231,&nbsp;</b><span style=font-weight:400>which is more than he'll make this entire preseason!</span></p><p>Based on the collective bargaining agreement, Hyder has yet to earn an accredited season in the NFL. Because of that, he's making just $1,000 per week during summer camp. That means his fine is about three times what he'll earn trying to land a spot on Detroit's roster over the six weeks of training camp.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-203691 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-596731550.jpg alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-203691 class=wp-caption-text>Patrick Smith/Getty Images</p><p>Luckily for Hyder, he can try to appeal his fine. He can point to his expected salary for the upcoming season as a reason, and he's unlikely to make the Lions roster.</p><p>The CBA has a provision for situations like this:</p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>On appeal, a player may assert, among other defenses, that any fine should be reduced because it is excessive when compared to the player's expected earnings for the season in question. However, a fine may be reduced on this basis only if it exceeds 25 percent of one week of a player's salary for a first offense, and 50 percent of one week of a player's salary for a second offense. A player may also argue on appeal that the circumstances do not warrant his receiving a fine above the amount stated in the schedule of fines.</span></i></p><p>Hyder was on the Lions practice squad in 2015, and the New York Jets practice squad the year before that. He's competing for a lower spot on the depth chart with about five other defensive tackles.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Making the roster sure would be a nice consolation prize for losing three times his preseason pay. Especially since the Lions <a href=#>usually don't catch a break</a> with penalty flags.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlZqaWoXqlscWepayhppp6rbXNnqSapl2itqi002afmq6VYre2v9Nmo6irpGK1qr%2BMnqWtoaKaerG%2BxKycmqufo3qxrdho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
