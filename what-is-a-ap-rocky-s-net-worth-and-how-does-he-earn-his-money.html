Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has been in the music game for a while, but he has his hands in more than one creative pot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/asap-rocky-at-grammys-party.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did A$AP Rocky’s music career begin?</h2><p id=par-2_67>A few years before launching his first musical project, Rocky became part of the A$AP Mob collective which includes other artists who work in music, fashion, and video production. Though he’s been rapping since childhood, there were two independent singles that set off his career: “Purple Swag” and “Peso.” Both became viral hits and set the framework for Rocky to launch his first mixtape in 2011, Live.Love.A$AP.</p><p id=par-3_73>The success of those works led to a record deal with Sony for $3 million, which, according to <a href=#>Biography</a>, was inked in the same month and year as the mixtape. That deal enabled him to create a record label with his A$AP partners and help launch other careers. Rocky’s debut album, Long.Live.A$AP dropped in 2013 to positive reviews and featured artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Florence Welch, Drake, A$AP Ferg, and 2 Chainz.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What other projects is the rapper working on?</h2><p id=par-4_51>In addition to music, Rocky has a major interest in fashion, which has led to some high profile and lucrative business ventures. Back in 2016, he made history as the first person of color to be the face of Dior Homme, and was featured in the high end fashion line’s ad campaign, <a href=#>Complex reported</a>.</p><p id=par-5_51>“Pretty Flacko,” as he’s sometimes called, also created a capsule collection with JW Anderson that included luxury streetwear pieces. In 2017, the rapper collaborated with fashion brand GUESS for a limited-edition collection of vintage style tees, jeans, and other pieces for men and women. He also modeled for the campaign.</p><p id=par-6_40>But fashion and music aren’t Rocky’s only bags. He also has some film credits under his name, appearing in movies like Dope and All Rise. His other current endeavors include a personal line of merchandise and modeling for Calvin Klein.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s A$AP Rocky’s net worth?</h2><p id=par-7_48>Between album sales, touring, modeling, and fashion, the rapper has multiple streams of income. He’s made the <a href=#>Forbes</a> “Highest Paid Hip-Hop Acts” lists in the past, and at one point was named one of the publication’s “30 Under 30 All Stars.” According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Rocky’s net worth is $6 million.</p><p id=par-8_53>In spite of the legal woes the star’s been dealing with for the past few months, fellow artists and business partners like Calvin Klein have expressed their continued support for him. Now that he’s back home in the US, he’ll likely want to enjoy some down time before heading back to work.</p><p id=par-9_48>This year, Rocky still has some tour dates in Europe and in the States, so he might decide to jump back onto a stage before the verdict on his assault case is delivered. He’s got almost 10 years of industry experience under his belt, and we’re sure there’s more to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZGorrF50aiapLFdo7K1edaoqa2gXp3BrriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
