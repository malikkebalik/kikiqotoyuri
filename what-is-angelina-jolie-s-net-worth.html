When she agreed to take on her iconic eponymous role in Maleficient she earned an impressive $33 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a>, and that’s just for the first movie. Her role opposite her ex-husband Brad Pitt in Mr. & Mrs. Smith got her a modest $10 million, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Jolie landed $20 million deals for Salt and The Tourist. Not too shabby.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Her impressive filming salary also explains her even more impressive Los Angeles home, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ideal Home </a>reports is worth $25 million. She bought the six-bedroom house, reportedly once owned by Cecil B. DeMille, and the 110-year-old estate reeks of Old Hollywood charm.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Jolie just recently released a clothing line in collaboration with the luxury brand Chloe, which will hit stores in January as a part of her newly launched Jolie Atelier, and is an effort to support diverse and sustainable fashion creation and design. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instyle</a> that her earnings from the collaboration will go towards “establishing apprenticeships for tailors and artisans.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Atelier Jolie (@atelierjolieofficial)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>One of the final things (as far as we know) that keeps Jolie afloat are designer branding deals and marketing campaigns. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>, she made a crisp $10 million for a Louis Vuitton print campaign back in 2011, and the price has gone up to a cool $12 million for her St. John’s deal, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a>.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>With all of that cash influx comes a responsibility to pay your dues, and Jolie has made a habit of it. She co-founded the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation</a> which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> calls a $41 million charity. She has been known to donate millions to help children across the world including No Kid Hungry, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instyle</a>.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Jolie has been working in the industry for more than 30 years, and her hard work has certainly paid off. With all of her brand partnerships, business ventures, and of course, highly-accolated acting, Celebrity Net Worth estimates Jolie’s net worth is at a modest $120 million. Those cheekbones, though? Priceless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGjtKa4yKeYZqKfobamv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
