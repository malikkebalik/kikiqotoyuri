He was 83 years old. Most people know Daniels for his hit song with the Charlie Daniels Band, “The Devil Went Down to Georgia,” but he had a lot of success outside of that song as well. So, since Daniels had such a successful career, we took a look at his <a href=#>net worth</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Charlie-Daniels-1.jpg><h2>Charlie Daniels had a great career in music</h2><p id=par-2_40>Daniels became a session musician after he first formed a band called the Jaguars at 21 years old that never hit it big, according to <a href=#>AllMusic</a>. He then ultimately became an extremely successful fiddler, playing on several Bob Dylan albums.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_37>However, in 1972 he formed the Charlie Daniels Band. Unlike the Jaguars, this band really took off. They first had a hit in 1973 called “Uneasy Rider” (which is actually just credited to Daniels, according to <a href=#>Billboard</a>).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_21>Then in 1979, the band got a No. 1 hit when they came out with “The Devil Went Down to Georgia.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_39>“Sometimes it takes a long time to write a song,” Daniels said to <a href=#>Billboard</a>. “This particular song just started coming once I got the story, and knew where I was going with it. I just kind of followed it.”</p><p id=par-6_12>The song ultimately became the Country Music Association’s Single of the Year.</p><h2>What is Daniels’ net worth?</h2><p id=par-7_44>Daniels ended up accomplishing a lot during his career. The album Fire on the Mount went platinum, according to AllMusic. Million Mile Reflections — which had “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” on it — also ended up going multi-platinum, and Windows went gold.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_48>The band had another hit in 1989 with “Simple Man” and then continued to have success at concerts even in recent years. Daniels was later inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 2007. He was also a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the <a href=#>Tennessean</a> reported.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>As we celebrate the life of Charlie Daniels, here's a video that was made for his 80th birthday with very quick clips from a life well-lived and a very long career, and TV, movie, commercial and pop culture refereneces.-TeamCDB/BW <a href=#>#RIPCD</a> <a href=#>#RIPCharlieDaniels</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/cR2TmXrJV7</a></p>— Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) <a href=#>July 6, 2020</a></figure><p id=par-9_86>“I’ve had things happen to me I didn’t even have the imagination to dream about years ago when I first started,” Daniels said last year, according to <a href=#>Forbes</a>. “I mean incredible things. I’ve been places, I’ve done things, and had successes I didn’t even dream of. I never imagined I’d go all over the world, play every state in the Union, and become a member of the Grand Ole Opry, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Musicians Hall of Fame. I had no idea.”</p><p id=par-10_19>Because of all of Daniels’ success in his career, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates that he is worth $20 million.</p><h2>Stars mourn the passing of Charlie Daniels</h2><p id=par-11_16>With Daniels being such a legend, many fellow artists and celebrities remembered him after his passing.</p><p id=par-12_37>Dolly Parton <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “Well, the devil went down to Georgia, but Charlie went straight to heaven. My heart, like many millions of others, is broken today to find out that we’ve lost our dear friend Charlie Daniels.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-13_29>Toby Keith also remembered him on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. “Charlie Daniels was part of my very first music collection. And a great guy. He showed us how it’s done. RIP superstar.”</p><p id=par-14_40>Additionally, President Donald Trump <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “We will miss GREAT Country Rocker, Charlie Daniels, who passed away yesterday in Hermitage, Tennessee. My condolences to his wife Hazel, and their family. Charlie is in my thoughts and prayers. I love his music!”</p><p id=par-15_13>Daniels is now gone, but he left an incredible music legacy behind.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZq6aq12YtaK%2By6KcZpyRo7amuNJmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpifrJWneqm10majnp%2BVo7GivthmpK6rmZh6pK3RnpyrZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
