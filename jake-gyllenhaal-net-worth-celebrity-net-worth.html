In 2016, Gyllenhaal appeared in Nocturnal Animals and subsequently followed up with the horror film Life, which was a critical disappointment. However, critics were much more impressed with Gyllenhaal's performance in 2017's Stronger, which was based on the experiences of a Boston Marathon Bombing survivor.</p><p>In 2018, Gyllenhaal appeared in films such as Wildlife and The Sisters Brothers.
