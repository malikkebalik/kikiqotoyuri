In fact, the writer believes that Aaron Paul’s character ends up happy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_33>After finally accruing the cash he needs to start a fresh life with a new identity, Jesse Pinkman met up with Ed Galbraith. He decides to head to Alaska on Mike Ehramntraut’s recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_16>During an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AmA on Reddit</a>, a fan asked Vince Gilligan if Jesse Pinkman ends up happy.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_25>“I really believe so. In my mind, yes. Don’t take that as gospel, just take that as what I personally want to believe,” Gilligan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_46>“It really is up to the individual viewer, however. There is no definitive answer, and it was left that way on purpose so that you guys could come up with the ending for Jesse that you saw fit. And for me, that ending was…ultimately…peace,” he added.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_26>Aaron Paul’s Breaking Bad character was beloved by many fans, who felt sympathy for Pinkman following the raw deal he received throughout most of the series.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-breaking-bad-jesse-pinkman-was-supposed-to-die>‘Breaking Bad’: Jesse Pinkman was supposed to die</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/elcamino1.jpg><p id=par-8_26>Interestingly, Jesse Pinkman was originally meant to be killed off early on in Breaking Bad.

He would say, ‘Hey, did you read the next script?’ And I go, ‘Nah, did you get it?’ And he’s like, ‘Oh.’ And he would just give me this big hug,” explained Paul.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_50>“I’d go, ‘What?’ He’s like, ‘Hey man, it had to end sometime, but at least you go out guns blazing,’ something like that. And I go, ‘What are you talking about?’ [He says] ‘Just read it and call me, if you want to talk.’ And then he would walk off!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs7HApKCnn12XrqV5yKxko52jqLJuvMinoqaZnmK1orzPsmSvoZ6Ysm6zyKWjop%2BRo3q1tMinoqxlo6R7qcDMpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
