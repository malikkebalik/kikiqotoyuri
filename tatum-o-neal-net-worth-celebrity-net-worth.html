Jackson called O'Neal his first love, but she called the relationship "a really wonderful friendship" and denied Michael's claims that she tried to seduce him. When a "Daily Beast" interviewer referred to Jackson as Tatum's "first public boyfriend," O'Neal responded, "He was somebody I knew and I did go on a date with, but I don't know about my first 'public boyfriend.' Let's call that the media's take on my first 'public boyfriend.'"</p><p>In 1984, she began a relationship with tennis player <a href=#>John McEnroe</a>, and they married on August 1, 1986.

Tatum and her father were estranged for 25 years, but in 2011, their reconciliation was documented for the <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> Network series "Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals."</p><p>In 2015, O'Neal told "People" magazine that she had started dating women, saying, "I think women are the most amazing creatures on earth. They're gentle, and also more intelligent than the men that I've met recently." In "A Paper Life," Tatum revealed she attempted suicide when she was 12 years old after walking in on her father and best friend (actress <a href=# title="Melanie Griffith Net Worth">Melanie Griffith</a>) together; she said that while she was unconscious, her father's drug dealer sexually assaulted her.
