And today, fans finally learned what that project is. Mysterio has announced that he will be jumping to the small screen.

However, when the supernatural forces of evil attack the city, Oscar gets to live his dream and team up with Mysterio to stop the evil. But this won’t be easy, as the evil forces take many different forms.

That it puts Mexico and Lucha Libre at the center even more, but that it stars Rey Mysterio, whom we have admired since we were children, is simply indescribable.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>The brothers went on to add:</p><p>“We believe that fans will greatly appreciate this new series, the result of the work and passion of so many people.”</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=false>There is a long tradition of Lucha Libre stars moving into film and TV.
