Styles P rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the East Coast hip hop group the Lox, alongside <a href=# title="Sheek Louch Net Worth">Sheek Louch</a> and Jadakiss. The group had its breakthrough with its debut album, "Money, Power & Respect," released in 1998. Styles P also has a solo career, with albums including "A Gangster and a Gentleman," "Time is Money," "Phantom and the Ghost," and "G-Host."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Styles P, whose real name is David Styles, was born on November 28, 1974 in the Queens borough of New York City to a South African mother and a Jamaican father. He had a younger brother named Gary. Following the divorce of their parents, the boys moved to Yonkers with their mother.</p><h2 id=lox><strong>The Lox</strong></h2><p>In Yonkers, Styles befriended Sean Jacobs and Jason Phillips. As high school students, the trio formed a group called the Bomb Squad and started recording demos and performing at local shows. In 1994, the group made an appearance on the song "Set it Off" by the hip hop group Main Source. The Bomb Squad was eventually renamed the Warlox. Fellow Yonkers native and singer Mary J. Blige eventually got ahold of the group's demo tape; impressed, she passed it along to rapper Sean Combs, who subsequently signed the Warlox to a record deal with his Bad Boy Records label. At Combs's urging, the trio changed its name to the Lox. Styles adopted the stage name Styles P, while Jacobs became Sheek Louch and Phillips became Jadakiss. In 1996, the Lox had its first single, "Well, Well, Well," which was featured on <a href=# title="DJ Clue Net Worth">DJ Clue</a>'s mixtape "Show Me the Money." The next year, the group rose to national prominence with the multi-platinum single "We'll Always Love Big Poppa," a tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G. The Lox also collaborated with Sean Combs on the remix of his hit single "It's All About the Benjamins."</p><p>The Lox had its big breakthrough with its debut album, "Money, Power & Respect," which was released in early 1998. The album made it to number three on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart; it also spawned the hit singles "If You Think I'm Jiggy" and the title track. In early 2000, the Lox released its second album, "We Are the Streets," through Ruff Ryder Records. Another commercial success, it launched the successful singles "Wild Out" and "Ryde or Die, Bitch." Following a long break during which the members of the group worked on their own solo projects, the Lox got back together to record its debut EP, "The Trinity," which came out in 2014. That was followed in late 2016 by "Filthy Americaâ€¦ It's Beautiful," the group's third studio album and first in 16 years. The Lox's next album was "Living Off Xperience," released in the summer of 2020.</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>In the summer of 2002, Styles released his first solo album, "A Gangster and a Gentleman."
