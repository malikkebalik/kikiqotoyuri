Sources say that the idea was apparently John’s, but as a fan, it wasn’t difficult to get Spears on board. The track will be her first single since “Slumber Party,” which appeared on her 2016 album Glory.</p><p>“This was Elton’s idea, and Britney is a huge fan. They have recorded a remix of ‘Tiny Dancer’ as a full duet — and it is incredible,” one music industry insider shares.</p><p>“They’ve already played it for people at their record label, and everybody is freaking out. It is so good,” the source teases. “They are saying this is going to be the song of the summer.</p><p>“Britney is officially back. She’s back to work, and she’s super excited.”</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>The recording session was reportedly overseen by record producer Andrew Watt, who has also worked with artists such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Ozzy Osbourne, Pearl Jam, and others in the past. In 2021, Watt also took home a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, so it sounds as if Spears and John are in good hands.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=false>It’s been a big year for Britney, who was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released from her 13-year conservatorship</a> last November, and recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wed her longtime boyfriend</a> Sam Asghari in a star-studded wedding last month. If Spears wants to make a comeback, it seems like there’s no time like the present.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46bqaKsnprGbr%2FPnpirq12aubW7zWahqKCeYrG2sdNmq6KmqWKxorrCnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
