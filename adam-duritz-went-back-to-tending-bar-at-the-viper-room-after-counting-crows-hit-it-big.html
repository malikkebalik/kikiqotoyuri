The band still releases new <a href=#>music</a> as recently as their album Butter Miracle Suite One on May 21. Back in the ‘90s, Duritz was a bartender at the Hollywood club <a href=#>The Viper Room</a>. As you’ll learn, Counting Crows was already a success back then, but Duritz wanted a normal job.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adam-Duritz-wearing-a-hat-and-leather-jacket.jpg><p id=par-2_75>Mark McGrath spoke with Showbiz Cheat Sheet by phone on July 15 about the Vice TV show Dark Side of the ’90s. One of the show’s episodes is about The Viper Room, so McGrath shared a story he witnessed firsthand as a club crawler in the ’90s. We’ll have more with McGrath as he tells stories from the ‘90s and new episodes of Dark Side of the ’90s air Thursdays at 10 p.m. on Vice.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-mcgrath-did-not-expect-to-run-into-adam-duritz-at-the-viper-room>Mark McGrath did not expect to run into Adam Duritz at The Viper Room&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_29><a href=#>Johnny Depp owned The Viper Room</a> in the ’90s. A lot of bands played the stage, but McGrath was not expecting to see a hit singer behind the bar.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Counting-Crows-singer-Adam-Duritz-performs-in-1994.jpg><p id=par-4_70>“You had Adam Duritz bartending,” McGrath said. “One day, I remember walking into The Viper Room, I snuck in, I knew one guy and he got me in the back room before Sugar Ray had any success. I remember walking in. And Adam Duritz [said], ‘Can I help you?’ I go, ‘Wow, man, the record business is a cruel mistress. I just heard your song on the way over here.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-viper-room-let-adam-duritz-felt-normal>The Viper Room let Adam Duritz felt normal</h2><p id=par-5_40>Counting Crows was not having a dry spell when Duritz worked The Viper Room. After “Mr. Jones” and the album August and Everything After, Counting Crows kept recording and performing.&nbsp;Duritz also gives an interview for Dark Side of the ‘90s.</p><p id=par-6_23>“He just wanted to work the bar to feel normal and do his thing,” McGrath said. “It was a great place for that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-mcgrath-has-other-great-memories-of-the-viper-room>Mark McGrath has other great memories of The Viper Room</h2><p id=par-7_21>Sugar Ray played The Viper Room, too. McGrath has many more fond memories of being in the audience for other artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Viper-Room-awning.jpg><p id=par-8_80>“So many great bands came out of The Viper Room,” McGrath said. “I think a lot of people forget about that. It was the places we mentioned bands would showcase. The Neurotic Outsiders, Duff McKagen’s first band after Guns n’ Roses, Matt Sorum with Steve Jones, they got their start there. Every band either showcased or did something there from Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins. It was the place to be because you never knew who would show up and play.”</p><p id=par-9_10>The Viper Room holds some personal memories for McGrath, too.</p><p id=par-10_44>“The irony of the Viper Room episode is it so directly affects me in so many ways,” McGrath said. “First of all, I met my wife there. I met my wife at the Viper Room and then I got engaged at the Viper Room.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSupa3MZpuuqpmpx27Ax55kr6Ggmr9uvs6opGabn6q7tbXNoGScqp%2BswG%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
