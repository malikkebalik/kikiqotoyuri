He had a troubled youth marked by gang crime, and in middle school spent nine months in a California youth facility after being arrested for possessing cocaine, marijuana, and a handgun. Johnson went on to attend Palisades High School and Susan Miller Dorsey High School, playing football at the latter in his senior year.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>Johnson began his collegiate career at West Los Angeles College, where he lasted just eight games on the football team due to poor behavior and failure to show up to practice.

At USC in 1994, Johnson posted 66 catches for 1,362 yards and nine touchdowns. The year after that, he recorded 102 catches for 1,434 yards and seven touchdowns.
