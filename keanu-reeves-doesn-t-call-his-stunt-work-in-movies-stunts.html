But Reeves disagreed with defining what he did as&nbsp;“stunts.”&nbsp;Instead, he preferred to call his&nbsp;sequences “physical acting.”</p><p id=par-3_32>“I&nbsp;get to do some physical acting. I get involved in some action&nbsp;but&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;not&nbsp;stunts. I flip over guys, I get flipped, I run, I jump, I play,”&nbsp;Reeves said in a 2014 interview with <a href=#>IndieWire</a>.</p><p id=par-4_31>Even at an older age, Reeves&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;shy away from doing his physical acting. Reeves quipped that his experience doing film stunts helped him keep up with the physicality of his action roles.</p><p id=par-5_37>“I’m&nbsp;at that wonderful line of experience, which helps when you&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;quite do what you used to be able to do. With the experience, you get it right faster&nbsp;so&nbsp;you&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have to do as many takes. I just made that up,”&nbsp;he&nbsp;said.</p><p id=par-6_15>Reeves also confided why he still preferred to do stunts nowadays even though he&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;have to.</p><p id=par-7_41>“I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know. I like it when it succeeds at making it&nbsp;emotional,&nbsp;or&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;a reason for the character&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;beyond escape. You know what I mean? Or survival. That&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;part of something.&nbsp;There’s&nbsp;character development and a character journey and it has an emotional component&nbsp;to&nbsp;it.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;dramatic storytelling. Not just spectacle,”&nbsp;he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keanu-reeves-did-some-of-his-nastiest-stunts-in-the-nbsp-john-nbsp-wick-nbsp-movies>Keanu Reeves did some of his nastiest stunts in the&nbsp;‘John&nbsp;Wick’&nbsp;movies</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_48>Being pure action films, the&nbsp;Reeves’&nbsp;John Wick&nbsp;franchise required the actor to perform some pretty dangerous stunt work.&nbsp;While doing these sequences, Reeves would not only&nbsp;be putting&nbsp;himself in danger, but also jeopardizing&nbsp;the safety of <a href=#>his co-workers</a>.&nbsp;Reeves recalled two mistakes on the set of&nbsp;John Wick&nbsp;that resulted in a couple of gruesome injuries.</p><p id=par-9_69>“So in terms of&nbsp;accidents:&nbsp;I made a mistake once – I cut a&nbsp;gentleman’s&nbsp;head open,”&nbsp;Reeves told <a href=#>ComicBook</a>.&nbsp;“So that&nbsp;really&nbsp;f***ing sucked – excuse my language. But other than that…oh, one guy got hit by a car. He was in the car, so he had to go to the hospital, but he was&nbsp;okay. All of this&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that you do have to take care. But&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;great that everyone [on set] is watching out for each other.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keanu-nbsp-reeves-nbsp-stunt-work-was-nbsp-very-impressive-nbsp-according-nbsp-to-this-nbsp-stuntman>Keanu&nbsp;Reeves’&nbsp;stunt work was&nbsp;very impressive&nbsp;according&nbsp;to this&nbsp;stuntman</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_44>Reeves has always had&nbsp;a huge&nbsp;respect and reverence for&nbsp;stuntmen,&nbsp;and vice versa. One of&nbsp;Reeves’&nbsp;most <a href=#>recent stunt doubles</a>, Vincent Bouillon, opened up about what it was personally like working alongside the actor. Buillon worked with Reeves in&nbsp;John Wick Chapter&nbsp;4,&nbsp;and echoed what other stunt doubles thoughts about Reeves.</p><p id=par-11_8>“He does a lot&nbsp;and&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;very impressive,”&nbsp;Buillon once told <a href=#>Express</a>.</p><p id=par-12_30>Bouillon was so impressed by&nbsp;Reeves’&nbsp;performance that he considered the actor a fellow&nbsp;stunt man. But he also explained that being a stunt double is&nbsp;about&nbsp;more than swapping out with the movie star.</p><p id=par-13_70>“It’s&nbsp;not just about doing the stunt that he cannot do because he can do&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;things,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;about caring. I try to copy his motion, his body [movements],&nbsp;and try to understand how he moves, why he moves like that, if he has any pains,”&nbsp;Buillon added.&nbsp;“So when you create the [fight choreography]&nbsp;you can say:&nbsp;‘Oh&nbsp;maybe we should replace this motion with something different because he has some trouble with his shoulder’&nbsp;or something like that.”</p><p id=par-14_18>Buillon also reminded&nbsp;how&nbsp;important efficiency is as a stunt double, as one mistake could set an entire scene back.</p><p id=par-15_51>“The goal is when Keanu or the other actors come up on the training day we can just go fast and be efficient to make sure everything goes in the right direction. If&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;a jump landing on the knees, the double makes sure he has pads on.&nbsp;Just&nbsp;taking care of the guy,”&nbsp;he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4pq3NrmSrnZWrsrR5w6icrKakYrCiuMtmqq2tnql6uLvRpGSmp6aesrR50q2sp6yjY7W1ucto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
