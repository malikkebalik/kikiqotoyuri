(They got me a very used, diesel station wagon â€“&nbsp;not my first choice, but at least it got me to the&nbsp;junior prom.) Ben "Kickz"&nbsp;Kapelushnik, a 16-year-old business prodigy has another goal: to make&nbsp;$1 million just this year from selling sneakers.</p><p>The young entrepreneur is the force behind Sneakerdon.com, a sneaker resell site that provides the rich, famous and sneaker-obsessed, with rare versions of the running shoes.&nbsp;Sneaker hobbyists on the hunt for 10-year-old kicks that look brand new have been around for decades. Ben found a way to harness their hunt into the flourishing resale market valued at $1.2 billion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-242482 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-800898778.jpg alt width=900 height=707 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-242482 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Magazine</a>&nbsp;article, Ben says after his mom bought him his first pair of Nikes in middle school he was a changed man. He read sneaker magazines, studied the resale market, attended sneaker conventions, and used his Bar-mitzvah money to buy more. In 8th grade, he bought a pair of LeBron X MVPs for $400 and immediately sold them to an 18-year-old friend for $4,000.</p><p>Now business is really&nbsp;boomin'&nbsp;(Ben's catchphrase)&nbsp;and the sneaker dealer is raking in the money and appearing in Instagram photos with famous DJs and rappers. Ben actually remembers the moment his phrase&nbsp;boomin'&nbsp;blew his mind. He was at <a href=#>DJ Khaled's</a> house with <a href=#>Hassan Whiteside</a> of the Miami Heat celebrating a big sale. Khaled asked Ben, "How's business?" and Ben answered, "boomin'."</p><p>"That was just the thing that came to my head," he told&nbsp;New York Magazine. "It's, like, a word, you know? It's like, boomin'.&nbsp;It's just a boomin' word. It's just boomin'!"</p><p>Ben&nbsp;should have trademarked his catchphrase because even his words are successful. <a href=#>Antonio Brown</a> of the Steelers has started using it as his catchphrase. Even Democratic nominee <a href=# title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth">Hillary Clinton</a> is down with the teen's lingo. When hip-hop personality Karen Civil posted a video asking her, "How's business," Clinton looked directly at the camera and replied, "boomin'."</p><p>Although he's made millions and has caught the attention of entertainers, football players, and world leaders, Ben's still a teenager who takes his 9-year-old brother, Daniel, out to lunch and likes goat-cheese balls because he's "kosher." In December, he told <a href=#>Complex</a> that he got in trouble with his teachers for bringing his phone to school. He dreams of going to college, getting an MBA degree, and opening a chain of retail stores.</p><p>"I just want to do something that I care about," he told Complex as he contemplated his future. Perhaps millions and a job he's passionate about are&nbsp;both in his future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmpqGcobawuoydpqWkkad6tLrEmqKeql2XwrS1zZ6qrGWSpLyutc1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
