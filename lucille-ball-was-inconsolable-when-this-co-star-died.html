By August 1979, Vance’s condition was terminal. Ball visited her friend and former co-star at her home in Belvedere, California that month for the last time.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_37>“You could hear them laughing, and towards the end there was a lot of sobbing,” Paige Peterson, a close friend of Vance’s, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. “It was an amazing thing to witness. The love of these two women.”</p><p id=par-4_24>Peterson had met Vance when she rented her mother’s home in Belvedere, and could vividly remember the final meeting between the two comedy legends.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_59>“We had brought Viv down and she was lying on the couch in the living room – they ate lunch and they talked and talked,” Peterson recalled, noting Vance’s sadness after the famous redhead left. “The pain on her face shook me to my core. She was in tears. She couldn’t speak. I think Viv gave up after that.”</p><p id=par-6_14><a href=#>Vance died a few</a> days later on Aug. 17. She was 70 years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DeYq9nhHJU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-love-lucy-star-grieved-the-loss-of-vivian-vance><strong>‘I Love Lucy’ star grieved the loss of Vivian Vance</strong></h2><p id=par-7_13>Ball’s <a href=#>daughter, Lucie Arnaz</a>, described how devastated her mother was by Vance’s death.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_28>“[They were] close friends,” Arnaz told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KCRW</a>. “Like sisters. It really killed my mother when Vivian passed away. She had weeks and weeks where she was just inconsolable.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_22>Playing besties for so many years created a unique bond between the two actors that surpassed what viewers saw on the screen.</p><p id=par-10_31>“They had to work so tight together and in such a short amount of time and create what they created,” Arnaz explained. “She always talked about how much fun it was.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lucille-ball-didn-t-want-vivian-vance-to-leave-the-lucy-show><strong>Lucille Ball didn’t want Vivian Vance to leave ‘The Lucy Show’</strong></h2><p id=par-11_35>Ball and Vance’s friendship hit a bump when Vance lobbied for more money and authority on The Lucy Show in order to return for season four. The thought of Vance leaving caused Ball great distress.</p><p id=par-12_72>“Lucy cried in private talking to me because she depended on Vivian,” co-star Gale Gordon revealed, according to the book “<a href=#>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz</a>”&nbsp;by Coyne Steven Sanders and Tom Gilbert.&nbsp; “She told me she could never do a show without Vivian. Lucy told me that, just prior to the break, Vivian was asking for more money than Lucy was willing to accept. It broke Lucy’s heart, really.”</p><p id=par-13_20>Fearing she would lose her <a href=#>most famous sidekick</a> and close pal, Ball was close to giving in to Vance’s requests.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_48>“Lucy said, ‘I want Vivian to stay – It’s very important to me,’” Desilu Productions VP Bernie Weitzman remarked. “‘She’s very helpful to me, consoles me, we have a great friendship.’ And she was the last of the old guard. [Lucy] had been very emotionally involved with her.”</p><p id=par-15_29>Ball eventually decided that Vance’s salary increase to almost a half million dollars was too high. Though Vance left the show, the two remained close friends until Vance’s death.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2brjOr5xmpKWYxm641JygpaSVYq%2BiuMtmoKebn6PAsLjAm6OeZZOkerTAwKtknaGVmXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
