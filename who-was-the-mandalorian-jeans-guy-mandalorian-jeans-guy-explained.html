This has led to many people bringing up the legendary jeans guy, but who is this forgotten&nbsp;Mandalorian&nbsp;character, and how did this meme begin?&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-who-is-jeans-guy data-injectable=false>Who is jeans guy?</h2><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>This meme originates from “Chapter 12: The Siege,” an episode from the show’s second season. “The Siege” is fascinating for many reasons, as it was directed by the legendary Carl Weathers, the actor who also plays Greef Karga. The episode’s story saw Greef, Cara, and Din heading into an old Imperial base, only to discover that the facility is home to a sinister cloning factory.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>During the episode, Greef, Cara, and Din fight a group of scientists. In one shot, viewers spotted a crew member’s body sticking out from behind a door. As the person was wearing blue jeans, they were quickly dubbed jeans guy by the online community.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>The concept of jeans guy quickly went viral, with many social media users making memes about this unknown but accidental addition to the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;universe. This included making cosplays of the character, turning him into action figures, and even concocting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elaborate fan theories</a> that suggest that he is the true master of the dark side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Coming soon (*Not really*)<br>Star Wars: The Mandalorian 'Jeans Guy' Action Figure. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/squJoECmR0</a></p>— Sub-City Comics (@SubCity_Comics) <a href=#>November 23, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>Even we here at We Got This Covered got in on the fun, covering several of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest memes from the episode</a>.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Many took to social media to ask the actors and those working on the show for more information about the mysterious figure. On Twitter, episode director Carl Weathers responded to the meme, calling the crewmember “a bogey.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true><p lang=es dir=ltr>A bogey! <a href=#>#BePeace</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/vJnsMqtvfL</a></p>— Carl Weathers (@TheCarlWeathers) <a href=#>November 20, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>It should be noted that Part of the reason for this meme’s popularity was that it came just over a year after&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;sparked an outcry when a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbucks coffee cup</a> was accidentally left in a scene. Plus, its memetic spread was further amplified by the fact that this was soon followed by several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other visual flubs</a>, with fans spotting poorly hidden crash pads and helicopters in other parts of the episode and those that followed it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-can-you-see-jeans-guy-today data-injectable=false>How can you see jeans guy today?</h2><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Alas, if you head to Disney Plus and try to spot jeans guy today, you’ll be out of luck. Under a week after the episode launched, Disney digitally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">edited the accidental cameo</a> out of the scene.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=false>So now, jeans guy only exists in old internet memes and in our hearts. However, in the future, we might see the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;brand edit jeans guy back into the scene and retroactively make him canon. Stranger things have happened.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrpqrXam1pnnMmqWdmZykv6qtzWahnpmeqHqowdhmpJqmlJa5sL7ImqVmopWWu7R5xq6wZp2opbmitc2em2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
