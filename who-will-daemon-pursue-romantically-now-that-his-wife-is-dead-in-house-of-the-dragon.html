He always makes his presence known. He paused royal festivities purely to walk in, making sure that everyone, especially his brother, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King Viserys</a>, knew he was there. He will stop at nothing to ensure that he has power, as that is clearly his only goal in this life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>He is willing to sacrifice anyone who might be in his way. This is what he did to his former wife, Lady Rhea, when he brutally killed her. His goal was to gain the inheritance to Runestone, as the two had no children so it was his after she died. However, Daemon will surely need a romantic partner if he ever wants a claim to the throne. Who will he pursue now that his wife is dead?</p><h2 id=h-who-will-daemon-pursue-romantically data-injectable=false>Who will Daemon pursue romantically?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rhaenyra-and-Daemon.jpg><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Daemon knows that he must get a wife in order to have a proper claim to the throne and gain power. The clear choice, even after her marriage, is still the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Rhaenyra</a>. The two would hold an undisputed claim and would be able to produce children that would become the leaders in the future.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>They already have chemistry, and Princess Rhaenyra still does have an eye for Daemon, even after he left her. She clearly wants him in some capacity, or she would not have gone with him on the dance floor and almost kiss him in episode five. Rhaenyra already has her claim, so it makes a lot of sense for Daemon to go after her and pursue her.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Another option for Daemon is Lady Laena Velaryon, the daughter of Lord Corlys and Rhaenys. She seemingly sparked an interest after seeing him walk in during the royal wedding festivities. It would make a lot of sense for Daemon to align himself with one of the wealthiest families in the kingdom. This would give Daemon the resources he would need to either overtake the throne or make a claim.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Daemon and Lord Corlys already have a working relationship together, so Lord Corlys would say yes and see the benefit. Daemon and Lady Laena would also be able to have children who would not have any rival claims to the throne, as it is clear that Princess Rhaenyra and Ser Laenor will most likely not have kids.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>Daemon knows that he will need a wife and kids for a claim to the throne. It will be interesting to watch who he goes after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqKknGKxorHMqKVmqKWnwLaxjKumppmeqbakrculsGamn6x6tbTArWShoaNixKqyxGagrGWUmq6lecinZKGnpaiybrvFZquhnV2Zv6Kzzqdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
