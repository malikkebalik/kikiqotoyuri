They have such grumpy little faces! Julianne Hough has two Cavaliers, I’m pretty sure. They feature quite heavily on her Instagram, and now one of them has made it to the cover of Redbook! GrumpyFace Puppy is a MODEL! Honestly, I would have preferred if this post had just been about the dog, but let’s go ahead and talk about Julianne. She’s currently promoting Dirty Grandpa (which was slammed by critics and audiences) and… she’s getting into the side-business thing. She’s doing a lifestyle website and an athletic-wear line. So, a little bit of Goop and a little bit of Kate Hudson. Some highlights from the interview:</p><p><strong>Why she’s no longer afraid to tell it like it is:</strong> “When I was 21, I did and said things because I wanted to be accepted. But there’s a point where you grow up. Now I’m much more honest with myself and other people.”</p><p><strong>Why she lets her fiancé Brooks Laich be her “leading man”:</strong> “Because of the nature of my career, it’s very easy for me to call the shots and ‘be the man.’ So it’s very nice to feel like a strong woman and still have my man be my leading man.”</p><p><strong>On embracing the good and bad times:</strong> “I’ve always been positive. But trust me, I have my days when I just break down and cry—and I don’t even know why I’m crying! I’m all about embracing those times, too. If you never feel sad about anything, there’s nothing dynamic to life—and that’s boring.”</p><p><strong>On learning to live life and love what you do: </strong>“A director once told me, ‘I’m getting too old for this s–t, so I only want to work with people who are going to make it fun.’ That’s true. Life’s too short. I’m not going to bust my butt on a movie just because it’s better for my career if it’s going to make me miserable.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Redbook]</a><br><br>“I’m not going to bust my butt on a movie just because it’s better for my career if it’s going to make me miserable” – I’m not sure what this means? She’s not going to take roles in movies that aren’t “fun”? She’s not going to work just to work? Whatever she’s trying to say, the result is that she sounds sort of out-of-touch. Millions of people don’t have a choice about being “miserable” on their jobs, you know? Plus, it’s not like Hollywood is breaking down her door, offering her great roles. She’s at a point in her career where she pretty much has to take whatever she’s offered.</p><p>As for the “be the man” thing… the entrenched gender stereotypes will get you every time. I understand what she’s trying to say, but she said it poorly.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hough2.jpg alt=hough2 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Alexei Hayes/Redbook.<br></p><a href=#><img width=112 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hough-redbook-112x150.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img width=100 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hough2-100x150.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW9ga313e8muo6KZnqOyoLTOrp6hl6eku7WrwZ6WsKeioLavs76opZiZnq6sp7XLpqqYoZaUtrW%2FvqCmoqaXlMGwq8yaop6XnZqsrrXSnqmampyafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
