Authorities are also looking into the death of Daybell’s former wife, Tammy Daybell, who worked as a librarian in Idaho. Chad married Lori Vallow, the mother of the two missing children, just two weeks after Tammy died. Lori Vallow’s former husband perished, too, at the hands of her brother, in a weird turn of events. Daybell and Vallow “were involved with a group called Preparing A People,” according to East Idaho News. The purpose of the organisation, according to its website, is to “assist in the preparation of the people of the earth for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.” Daybell has a bachelor’s degree in Communications from Brigham Young University.</p><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chad_Daybell_Career></span>Chad Daybell&nbsp;Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>Chad Daybell is an author of the book that focuses on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. According to his website, Chad Daybell “has worked in the publishing business for the past two decades and has published more than 25 books. He is the president of Spring Creek Book Company at the moment. Chad is also recognized for his non-fiction publications for youth, such as The Aaronic Priesthood and The Youth of Zion, as well as his other novels such as Chasing Paradise and The Emma Trilogy. In addition, he and his wife Tammy produced the Tiny Talks series for primary school children.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chad-Daybell-trial-300x290.jpg.webp alt="Chad Daybell" width=745 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h4 style=text-align:left><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chad_Daybell_Personal_Life></span><strong>Chad Daybell&nbsp;Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>Tamara (Tammy) Douglas Daybell “went away quietly in her sleep on Saturday, October 19th, 2019 in Salem, Idaho,” according to her obituary. “She met Chad Daybell during the summer following her freshman year at Brigham Young University,” according to the obit. They instantly fell in love and married in the Manti Temple on March 9th, 1990. Tammy supported the family by working as a secretary for the Springville Parks Department while Chad pursued his education. She was survived by five children in addition to her spouse.</p><p>Human remains have been discovered in Lori Vallow’s husband’s home, and officials are trying to figure out if they belong to the doomsday-obsessed mom’s two missing children, according to officials. Throughout the investigation, detectives and investigators have recovered what they believe to be human remains that have not been identified at this time,” Assistant Chief Gary Hagen of the Rexburg Police Department told reporters during a brief press conference in Idaho, hours after they executed a search warrant at Chad Daybell’s home. Chad Daybell, who lives at the house where the remains were discovered, has also been arrested and is being questioned about it.</p><p><span style=font-size:1rem>Here </span><span style=font-weight:400>is</span><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;the fu</span><span style=font-size:1rem>ll bio of&nbsp;
