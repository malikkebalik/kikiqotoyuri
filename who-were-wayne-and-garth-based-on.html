In the recurring skits, the two play rock fans who conduct interviews and present top-ten lists on a local cable access show.</p><p id=par-3_25>Both films were written by Myers and produced by SNL showrunner Lorne Michaels. They went on to become the highest-grossing movies based on SNL characters.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mike-myers-based-wayne-cambell-on-his-childhood-friends>Mike Myers based Wayne Cambell on his childhood friends</h2><p id=par-4_73>Myers created the character of Wayne Campbell before joining SNL. “I did it at Second City in Toronto, and I did it at Second City in Chicago, and then I got on Saturday Night Live,” Myers told Josh Gad on his <a href=#>Wayne’s World Reunited Apart</a> show. “I did it on Saturday Night Live, and I looked at the cast, and I said, ‘Who is the funniest person here?’ And I was like, ‘Dana.’”</p><p id=par-5_42>The Canadian actor and comedian used a lot of his own experiences to create the concepts in Wayne’s World. And in a 1990 interview <a href=#>CBC’s Midday</a>, he revealed that Wayne was inspired by friends he hung out with in the Ontario suburbs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_56>“Well I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto and it was you know just basically the group of people I hung out with who we used to just take the red racket into town,” Myers said. “Sort of an adolescent suburbia heavy metal thing — they were sort of funny people to hang out with.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dana-carvey-s-brother-inspired-his-wayne-s-world-character>Dana Carvey’s brother inspired his ‘Wayne’s World’ character</h2><p id=par-7_59>In Wayne’s World, Garth is Wayne’s shy but insightful best friend. He’s not as outgoing or boisterous as Wayne, but he has a sneaky genius streak that shows up in the movies. And there’s a reason for that. When talking to <a href=#>Howard Stern in 2019</a>, Carvey revealed that he based the character on his brilliant engineer brother, Brad Carvey.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_57>“That’s why Garth had the stun gun because Brad’s kind of…he invented the Video Toaster and he’s an engineer at Sandia Labs… he’s very very talented,” he said. “I call him a genius. But Brad if we call him right now, [he’s the] master of understatement, ‘Yeah I could make a nuclear device out of a paperclip.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_23>“And that was kind of the core voice for Garth,” Carvey continued. “And there’s something very intoxicating about that rhythm that understated lilt.”</p><p id=par-10_37>Myers and Carvey recently reprised their roles as Wayne and Garth. In a Super Bowl commercial for Uber Eats, the two friends — who are joined by Cardi B — encourage their viewers to support local restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEosXNnqpmr5%2BnuaV51qGmZq%2BVp7Juw8CypZ5lkaOxbrPAq6uhZZKWwKawjKilZ6Ckorlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
