"It's made to give birth and have a baby and be a cozy companion for it afterward. And for my body, that meant putting on a lot of weight [with Milo]."</p><a href=#>//instagram.com/p/puZHRuvJGr/</a><p>Although the Mistresses star was bullied during her last pregnancy over her weight gain, she has learned to simply ignore the haters.</p><p>"I didn't indulge in fast food or junk food, so I knew it was a healthy weight," she explains. "I just realized: This is what my body needs to do to have a healthy baby" and reasons, "We don't get hungry when we're pregnant for no reason."</p><p>And to keep up that positive thinking, Alyssa, who's due early this fall, hasn't looked at a scale throughout her entire pregnancy.</p><a href=#>//instagram.com/p/qzhVFGPJP9/</a><p>"You're making a skeletal system. You're making organs. I refuse to look at the scale," she reveals. "It's funny, my file was open at my appointment yesterday and there was a big Post-it note that said, 'She does not want to know her weight.'"</p><p>Though she remains in the dark about the amount she's gained, the Project Runway: All Stars' host does know she's expecting a girl!</p><p>"I had morning sickness this time, but it went away right at 12 weeks," Alyssa tells Fit Pregnancy magazine. "With Milo, I didn't have a minute of morning sickness. So I knew it was going to be a girl."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao7Kro5Z6rrXLmqWoZaKas7a%2FxKxkraddobywt4yaq2aZXaiworjEZq6hoZyaerG%2BxKClmqakYoFxhJhsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
