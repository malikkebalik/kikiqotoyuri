As you can see, that bulky sweater and strategically placed scarf are trying to hide her growing baby bump. It really seems like all of the Brazilian and American gossips were right – Gisele is pregnant with her second. Good for her. And can I just say? I think she’s prettier when she’s pregnant. I know Gisele gets a lot of criticism for not having a real “supermodel face” but when she’s filled out a bit (like in these photos), I think she’s incredibly beautiful. The added weight looks great on her, and her face doesn’t seem so angular.</p><p>Additionally, Gisele <a href=#>was named “the highest paid model” in the world by Forbes</a> several days ago. Gisele had $45 million in earnings – just for May 2011 to May 2012. Kate Moss was ranked #2, with only $9 million in earnings for the same time period. So not only is Gisele the top-earning supermodel in the world, you could argue that no other model even comes close to creating the kind of firestorm and global headlines like Gisele. I think that’s probably Gisele’s answer to David Gandy, <a href=#>who criticized her a week ago</a>. Gisele to Gandy: “SUCK IT. I’M RICH.”</p><p>Back to Gisele and her bump… Tom Brady was at a promotional event for Under Armour yesterday, and he talked a little bit about Gisele, his hair and whether they’re expecting. <a href=#>You can read the full thing here</a>, and here are some highlights:</p><p><strong>SI.com: I think the last time Hot Clicks had fun with your hair was a few weeks ago when you went to a fashion ball. You were rockin’ a faux hawk, I believe.</strong><br>Brady: Yeah, it was. Just a little different haircut.</p><p><strong>SI.com: When it comes to the hair, do you go with what [wife] Gisele [Bundchen] likes or do you make the decisions on your own?</strong><br>Brady: She likes pretty much what I like. She leaves it to me. Every man should know, if you’re comfortable and you like it, you should do it. Everyone always worries about what the girls think, what the guys think. If you like it, do it. To me, if you’re trying to impress a girl, get a date, they’re gonna like that more because you’re a confident guy. That’s what it comes down to.</p><p><strong>SI.com: Is there anything bad about being married to a supermodel?</strong><br>Brady: [Laughing, followed by long pause] Um, it’s a marriage, so I have a life partner. Like most marriages, there’s a lot of give and take.</p><p><strong>SI.com: You mentioned you have two kids. There are rumors that you guys are having a third. I don’t know if you want to get into that or not.</strong><br>Brady: I like working on it.</p><p><strong>SI.com: Do you really wear Uggs?</strong><br>Brady: Damn right I do.</p><p><strong>SI.com: Have you gotten your teammates to wear Uggs?</strong><br>Brady: Damn right I have.</p><p><a href=#>[Via SI]</a></p><p>So… Tom Brady was saying <a href=#>that the Met Gala fauxhawk</a> was his idea? I don’t believe him. I do think Gisele makes suggestions about his hair. As for Tom’s non-confirmation, non-denial about Gisele’s pregnancy… I wonder what they’re waiting for? Maybe they don’t want to make a formal announcement?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3957560.jpg alt title=wenn3957560 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3957556.jpg alt title=wenn3957556 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3957558.jpg alt title=wenn3957558 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3957564.jpg alt title=wenn3957564 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wenn3957557.jpg alt title=wenn3957557 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2tlaIZ2e8aiqp6klZSvtrrDnJ%2Bepo%2Bptaarx6KeoZ2jqayxrcidlqanlJq5oLXNmKuhnY%2BsvLO4w5iqoaenqKywssWYn56qj5fCrry%2BoqWYmqKWx6q4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
