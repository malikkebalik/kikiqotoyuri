Siding with Austin Li Coon and Drew Basile instead of Kendra McQuarrie and Brando Meyer, Brando was eliminated to conclude the episode.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Having a whirlwind of a journey on Survivor 45 thus far, finally finding herself in a power position, Emily shared with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> one of her favorite memories of the season prior to the merge, and this moment is sure to make you giggle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lulu-Tribe-Survivor-2.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 data-characters=179 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>When asked the question, “What was your favorite moment you experienced this season leading up to the merge?” Emily’s response was unexpected (to say the least).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>“For some reason, the first memory that comes to mind is our very first night on Lulu beach,” she prefaced, before explaining what she discussed with Hannah, Brandon, Sabiyah, Sean, and Kaleb that evening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 data-characters=266 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>She dished, “We had no shelter, and everyone was lying on the ground, trying to sleep.
