Indeed, the sex comedy’s premise is nothing short of uncomfortable, which may be more than enough to put some people off from taking the plunge, but those who give it a chance just might be pleasantly surprised at the film’s tender, important message, and lens, powered in part by Lawrence’s infallible charm.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Inspired by a real Craigslist ad sent to writer-director Gene Stupnitsky by a pair of the film’s producers, No Hard Feelings stars Lawrence (who also produces) as Maddie, a struggling, 32-year-old Uber driver whose car gets repossessed as property taxes on her inherited childhood home continue to go unpaid. As she scours the web for solutions, she happens upon a couple, Allison and Laird Becker, who offer her a used car in exchange for dating Percy, their 19-year-old, introverted, sexually-disinterested son, so as to bring him out of his shell, as it were.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Of course, No Hard Feelings is a movie released in 2023, so the main question on everyone’s mind is whether or not there’s a post-credits scene in play. Can’t risk sitting through the names of the people who made the movie without that extra payoff, right?</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-post-credits-scene-in-no-hard-feelings data-injectable=false>Is there a post-credits scene in No Hard Feelings?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/no-hard-feelings.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>No, there is no post-credits scene or mid-credits scene in No Hard Feelings. It’s no surprise that this is the case, of course; no one should be going into this movie expecting it to set up any sort of shared universe, even if the thought is equal parts hilarious and uncanny.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>No Hard Feelings is now playing in cinemas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2K7sHnHmqmdZZaasq21zaCqZqCRq7JurYyppqysXZi%2FprDIrapmq5Oau6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
