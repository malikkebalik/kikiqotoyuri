Through flashbacks told from the perspective of an elderly Evelyn Hugo, we not only learn about how (and why) Evelyn acquired seven husbands, but also about Celia St. James, known to the world as the girl next door, the winner of multiple Oscars, and “America’s Sweetheart.” We also learn she and Evelyn shared more than just a love of movies in common. Wink-wink.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Ever since The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was picked up by Netflix in March — thanks in large part to the novel’s astronomical popularity on TikTok’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subcommunity BookTok</a> — fans have been clinging to the hope that the character of Celia St. James would wind up in the hands of a talented, capable, and worthy actress. Enter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jessica Chastain</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-big-announcement-that-convinced-fans-jessica-chastain-would-play-celia-st-james data-injectable=false>The ‘big announcement’ that convinced fans Jessica Chastain would play Celia St. James</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jessica Chastain (@jessicachastain)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Chastain has been at the top of fans’ wish lists to play Celia for her charisma, humbleness, acting chops, and striking similarities to the novel version of the character, red hair and all. On Nov. 15, 2022, Chastain whetted appetites with news that she had a “very exciting” announcement regarding her next project, which she would deliver the following day.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>If you take a peek at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comments section</a> of Chastain’s post, you’ll find a tsunami of excited Evelyn Hugo fans all but convinced the big announcement is her taking on the role of Celia St. James. However, hopes were squashed two days later when Chastain revealed the big announcement was her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">return to Broadway</a> in the production of A Doll’s House, not Evelyn Hugo.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Still, Chastain remained — and remains — the top pick to play Celia St. James. Doing nothing to staunch the rumors, Chastain expressed interest in playing the character when she appeared on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in January. “Sure, send me the script,” she said when asked if she would do it.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>So, the question remains: Will Chastain put her fiery red hair and Academy Award-winning acting chops to good use as Celia St. James in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo? Or is it all just wishful thinking?</p><h2 id=h-so-is-celia-st-james-in-the-cards-for-jessica-chastain-after-all data-injectable=false>So, is Celia St. James in the cards for Jessica Chastain after all?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know how excited many you are about adaptations. Please dont read too much into a video. There is no news about anything. Except that I’m onstage until June 10th. Hope to see you 🤍 <a href=#>#ADollsHouse</a></p>— Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>Even though Jessica Chastain’s “big announcement” was not about The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, the desire for her to play Celia St. James fervently increased after she expressed interest in reading the script. Up until that point, the actress had not acknowledged the increasing fan chatter. Unfortunately, on April 20, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a TikTok video</a> of Chastain declining to sign one fan’s book went viral after she told a fan, “I can’t sign that. Just because I’m not doing it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Chastain, aware of the online chatter, took to Twitter to explain her reasoning. “I’ve been asked multiple times by fans, to sign books that I’m not attached to contractually,” she said in her post. “Because it feels wrong, and like I’m taking credit for someone else’s work, I’ll say I can’t sign because I’m not doing it. That doesn’t mean I’ve read a bad script.”</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>She added, “I know how excited many [of] you are about adaptations. Please don’t read too much into a video. There is no news about anything. Except that I’m onstage until June 10th. Hope to see you.”</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>There you have it. Straight from Chastain’s mouth. On the surface, it very much reads like she has confirmed she is not playing Celia St. James. Worth noting, however, is the vague, contradicting language she uses in between, which can be interpreted one of two ways.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>She says, “Because I’m not doing it,” implying exactly what the sentiment conveys, but then says, “There is no news about anything,” which reads a lot like the possibility is still in the cards. At a minimum, no one has been cast yet, which leaves the door still open.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>All that aside, fans will have to hold out a little while longer for news about Chastain as St. James, as well as the entirety of the Evelyn Hugo cast. When it is announced, rest assured we will cover it, so stay tuned for updates. In the meantime, check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our list of actresses</a> who would be more than capable candidates to fill Celia St. James’ shoes should the role, indeed, not go to Chastain.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Additionally, fans of Evelyn Hugo can hold themselves over with yet another Taylor Jenkins Reid adaptation — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy Jones & The Six</a>. The limited series is now on Amazon Prime Video, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if you ask us</a>, it’s pretty good.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqKknGK3pr%2FSopqaZZOdrrTAwKKlZqiclsZur8SloJplo6l6q63MnqpmoZ5iu6bAxaWgsatdqbWmedKerZ6mXZ3CtK7Ap5usZZ%2BbeqbCxKWwp2WYqrSwew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
