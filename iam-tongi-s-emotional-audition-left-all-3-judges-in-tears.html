He was the one who taught him to play music, so he dedicated his try-out to him.</p><p id=par-4_35>After listening to his story, the judges were obviously hopeful he would pass. “We’re fixin’ to get you priced back into Hawaii,” <a href=#>country star Luke Bryan</a> told him reassuringly before he started to perform.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Iam Tongi brought all 3 American Idol judges to tears with his rendition of ‘Monsters’ by James Blunt</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_28>Tongi was already emotional after mentioning his late father, but he launched into a beautiful acoustic version of James Blunt’s “Monsters,” bringing all three judges to tears.</p><p id=par-6_64>It’s worth noting that <a href=#>Blunt’s heartbreaking song</a> was written while his father was waiting for a kidney donor with stage-four chronic kidney disease, so Tongi’s performance was emotional. “I’m not your son, you’re not my father / We’re just two grown men saying goodbye / No need to forgive, no need to forget / I know your mistakes and you know mine,” he sang.</p><p id=par-7_39>Lionel Richie had difficulty composing himself during the performance.
