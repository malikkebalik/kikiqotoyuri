While the Detroit native could have just rested on his laurels and lived off the money made off of album sales, Em has shown that he has an entrepreneurial spirit. Last year, he, along with <a href=#>Nas</a> and <a href=#>Pharrell</a>,&nbsp;invested in Genius (formerly known as Rap Genius), a song lyric annotation website, and now the 43-year-old is investing in yet another website.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>StockX, a website which refers to itself as "the world's first online consumer 'stock market of things,'" announced last week that Eminem and his manager, <a href=# title="Paul Rosenberg Net Worth">Paul Rosenberg</a>, will be investing in the company's online trading platform. While the site refers to itself as the "stock market of things," the site currently focuses on sneakers. The website is a live 'bid/ask' marketplace that lets buyers place bids, sellers to put a price on their sneakers, and allows a trade to go through when the seller's asking price matches a buyer's asking price. The website only allows sneakers that are in deadstock, unworn condition to be put up for sale on the site. StockX also assures the authenticity of every sneaker involved in a trade, utilizing a proprietary process to verify the authenticity the sneaker before it is sent out to the buyer.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198408 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-484684095.jpg alt="(Frederick M.
